# optimization-problems
Repository with some solutions for optimizations problems.

## Problems

* Knapsack: the simple 0-1 knapsack problem.

## Mixed Integer Programming
Files with the extension `.mip.py` are the ones where the solution used is a MIP algorithm. They utilize the external solver [SCIP](http://scip.zib.de/) and the interface lib [PySCIPOpt](https://github.com/SCIP-Interfaces/PySCIPOpt).
